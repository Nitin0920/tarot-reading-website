# ArcanaAi, Where Tarot Meets Intelligence
# Tarot Reading Website – Project Abstract

This project presents the design and development of a Tarot Reading Website that provides users with an interactive and engaging digital tarot experience. The website allows users to draw tarot cards and receive interpretations that offer insights into personal growth, emotions, and future possibilities.

The application is built using modern web technologies such as React with TypeScript and Vite, ensuring fast performance, modular design, and scalability. Smooth animations and an intuitive user interface enhance user engagement, while structured routing enables seamless navigation across different sections of the website.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how traditional tarot reading concepts can be transformed into a digital platform while maintaining user experience, responsiveness, and accessibility. This project highlights practical implementation of frontend development concepts, component-based architecture, and interactive design, making it suitable as an academic mini-project for web development.
