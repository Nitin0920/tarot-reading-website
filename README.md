# ArcanaAi, Where Tarot Meets Intelligence
# Tarot Reading Website – Project Abstract


The Tarot Reading Website is a modern web-based application designed to provide users with an interactive and engaging digital tarot reading experience. The platform allows users to explore tarot cards and receive meaningful interpretations that offer insights into emotions, personal growth, and future possibilities. By transforming traditional tarot reading concepts into a digital format, the project demonstrates how technology can be used to enhance user interaction and accessibility.

This application is developed using React with TypeScript and Vite, ensuring high performance, scalability, and maintainable code structure. The component-based architecture enables efficient state management and smooth navigation across different sections of the website. Modern UI libraries and animation frameworks are used to deliver a visually appealing and responsive user interface that works seamlessly across devices.

The primary objective of this project is to apply frontend web development concepts such as routing, reusable components, animation, and responsive design in a real-world application. The project also focuses on user experience by providing intuitive interactions and clear visual feedback. This Tarot Reading Website serves as an academic mini-project that showcases practical implementation of modern web technologies and creative UI design.
